# Python Datafly

## Bugs Founded in prof. solutions:
- costs function are not well explained

## Lessons Learned
- indexes can be used instead of slicing array in recursive functions
  - sometimes can be less readable
  - can be very difficult to avoid out of bounds issues
- it's better to define immediately limit cases and usage

Example of execution: python3 k-degree/k-degree.py 5 datasets/graph_friend_100_10_100.csv
